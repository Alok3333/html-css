      Once your image is ready for some fancy lettering, it’s time to browse the
      “Text” pane. The text pane has lots of features, and there are plenty just
      beneath the surface, but it’s super easy to get started. Just click on
      “Add text” and a little text box will be added to your picture. You can
      move or scale your text just like any other design element. Once you know
      what you’d like to say, click the inside of the text box to add text to
      the image. It’s that easy.
