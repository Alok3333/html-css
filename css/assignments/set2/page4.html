          "Coding is the only global language and I wish that more Indian
          students, including girls, learn coding early in school days so that
          they can create world-class products and solve real-life problems as
          they grow up," Apple CEO Tim Cook has stressed. In an interaction with
          IANS during his India visit last week, Cook said that coding is one
          thing schools worldwide including in India should embrace early in
          children's lives. "Coding is the only global language. It is a way to
          express yourself and arguably, we need more of that in the world and
          bring the world closer," said Cook, who has always emphasised that
          coding should be taught as early as elementary school. Something that
          I learned from talking to Bex is that there is a storytelling aspect
          to writing descriptions. It doesn’t necessarily make sense to go from
          left to right describe everything in an image because that might lose
          the central message or create a disorienting feeling. For that reason,
          I came up with a framework that I recommend called
          object-action-context. The object is the main focus. The action
          describes what’s happening, usually what the object is doing. The
          context describes the surrounding environment. What counts as
          “essential” can sometimes be subjective. In my research, some people
          preferred very brief descriptions while others preferred a great deal
          of visual detail (like Robin and Bex). My best advice in this area is
          to be as descriptive as your audience needs. You know your audience
          and your content best. If your work is highly visual and your audience
          is interested, then add more detail. If you and your audience care
          more about the non-visual content, then keep it on the shorter side.
          It should be objective so that people using the description can form
          their own opinions about what the image means. It should be concise so
          that it doesn’t take too long for people to absorb all the content,
          especially if there are multiple images. And it should be descriptive
          enough that it describes all the essential aspects of the image. If
          you and your audience care more about the non-visual content, then
          keep it on the shorter side. It should be objective so that people
          using the description can form their own opinions about what the image
          means. It should be concise so that it doesn’t take too long for
          people to absorb all the content, especially if there are multiple
          images. And it should be descriptive enough that it describes all the
          essential aspects of the image.
