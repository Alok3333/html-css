      Once your image is ready for some fancy lettering, it’s time to browse the
      “Text” pane. The text pane has lots of features, and there are plenty just
      beneath the surface, but it’s super easy to get started.

      Just click on “Add text” and a little text box will be added to your
      picture. You can move or scale your text just like any other design
      element. Once you know what you’d like to say, click the inside of the
      text box to add text to the image. It’s that easy.
